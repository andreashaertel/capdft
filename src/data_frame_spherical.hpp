 *
 *  The DFSpherical is a data class of capDFT for spherical geometries,
 *  which can hold data like density profiles,
 *  functional derivatives, or external potential fields.
 *  The DFSpherical provides the specific implementation of the
 *  DFSpherical class for the spherical geometry.
 *  It contains all virtual functions of the parent and some additional quality
 *  of life functions. The use of templates makes the extension to other vaiable
 *  types like "int" easier.
